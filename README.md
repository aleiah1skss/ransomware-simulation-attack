# Ransomware Simulation Demo (Safe Educational Project)

This project demonstrates **how ransomware encrypts files**, but in a **safe, harmless, and fully local way**.

## 🔒 What This Project Does
- Encrypts any file using AES-GCM (client-side)
- Decrypts the file using the same passphrase
- All processing happens locally in your browser
- No data is uploaded anywhere
- A dashboard explains how real ransomware works

## 🚫 What This Project Does NOT Do
- No spreading
- No deleting files
- No exploiting systems
- No malicious behavior of any kind

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- WebCrypto API (AES-GCM)
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## 📚 Purpose
This project is for:
- Cybersecurity students
- Demonstrating encryption concepts
- Understanding ransomware behavior safely
